<p>This game features two modes, a free roam and story mode. The story mode activity of the game is the progress through a linear, vertical level shooting down enemy ships. The player also collects objects called ‘Pixels’ which add to the size and power of their ship. The free roam mode puts the player’s ship in a large open space with ships of all sizes.  This feature would be played using a sort of evolution system like the first stage in ‘Spore’ where the player attacks smaller ships while gaining size through earned pixel, eventually taking on larger ships as the player ships grow. The free roam mode is also permadeath, meaning if they die they lose the ship forever. The player can uncover a map in free roam that is covered in darkness by exploring, finding colonies and enemies along the way.</p>
